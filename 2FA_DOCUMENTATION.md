# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

## Overview
This Django project now includes a comprehensive Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system that adds an extra layer of security to user accounts. When users log in, they'll receive a verification code via email that must be entered to complete the authentication process.

## Features Implemented

### üîê Security Features
- **Email-based verification codes**: 6-digit codes sent to user's email
- **Code expiration**: Verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- **Anti-replay protection**: Each code can only be used once
- **Login attempt tracking**: Monitor successful and failed login attempts
- **IP address tracking**: Track login attempts by IP for security analysis
- **Suspicious activity detection**: Detect new devices and repeated failed attempts

### üé® User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed verification page with Bootstrap styling
- **Auto-focus**: Code input field is automatically focused
- **Auto-submit**: Form submits automatically when 6 digits are entered
- **Resend functionality**: Users can request new codes with cooldown protection
- **Real-time feedback**: Instant validation and error messages
- **Responsive design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop

### üõ† Admin Features
- **2FA Management**: View all verification codes and their status
- **Login Monitoring**: Track all login attempts with detailed information
- **Security Analytics**: Monitor suspicious activities and patterns
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML and text email templates

## How It Works

### For Users
1. **Login Process**:
   - Enter username/email and password
   - If credentials are correct, a 6-digit code is sent to their email
   - Enter the verification code on the 2FA page
   - Successfully logged in after code verification

2. **Security Benefits**:
   - Even if someone knows your password, they can't access your account without access to your email
   - Protection against unauthorized access from new devices
   - Real-time notifications of login attempts

### For Administrators
1. **Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - View all 2FA codes generated
   - Track login attempts and success rates
   - Monitor suspicious activities
   - Analyze security patterns

2. **Email Configuration**:
   - Currently set to console backend for development
   - Easy switch to SMTP for production
   - Customizable email templates

## Configuration

### Email Settings
```python
# Development (emails printed to console)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

# Production (actual emails sent)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
```

### 2FA Settings
```python
TWO_FACTOR_ENABLED = True
VERIFICATION_CODE_LENGTH = 6
VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRY_MINUTES = 10
```

## Models Added

### TwoFactorAuth
- Stores verification codes
- Tracks code usage and expiration
- Links codes to specific users
- Supports different code types (login, sensitive actions)

### LoginAttempt
- Records all login attempts
- Tracks IP addresses and user agents
- Monitors success/failure rates
- Enables security analytics

## New URLs
- `/auth/verify-2fa/` - Verification code entry page
- `/auth/resend-2fa-code/` - AJAX endpoint for resending codes

## Templates
- `auth/verify_2fa.html` - Modern verification page
- `emails/verification_code.html` - Professional HTML email template
- `emails/verification_code.txt` - Plain text email template

## Testing the System

### Development Testing
1. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Go to `/login/` and enter valid credentials
3. Check the console for the verification code email
4. Enter the code on the verification page
5. Successfully login to dashboard

### Production Setup
1. Configure real SMTP settings in `.env`
2. Change `EMAIL_BACKEND` to SMTP in settings
3. Test with real email addresses
4. Monitor admin interface for security insights

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- ‚úÖ Never share verification codes with anyone
- ‚úÖ Log out from shared computers
- ‚úÖ Report suspicious login notifications immediately
- ‚úÖ Use strong, unique passwords

### For Administrators
- ‚úÖ Monitor login attempts regularly
- ‚úÖ Set up email alerts for suspicious activities
- ‚úÖ Review failed login patterns
- ‚úÖ Keep email credentials secure
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for sensitive settings

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- üì± SMS-based verification as alternative to email
- üîî Push notifications for login attempts
- üìä Security dashboard with analytics
- ü§ñ AI-powered suspicious activity detection
- üì± Mobile app integration
- üîë Hardware token support

### Customization Options
- Adjustable code length and expiry time
- Custom email templates per organization
- Whitelist trusted IP addresses
- Geographic location-based security
- Time-based access restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not received**: Check spam folder, verify email settings
2. **Code expired**: Request a new code (60-second cooldown)
3. **Invalid code**: Ensure exact 6-digit entry, no spaces
4. **Session expired**: Start login process again

### Admin Diagnostics
- Check `LoginAttempt` model for failed attempts
- Verify `TwoFactorAuth` codes are being generated
- Monitor email backend logs
- Review Django console for errors

## Support

For issues or questions about the 2FA system:
1. Check the admin interface for login diagnostics
2. Review console logs for error messages
3. Verify email configuration settings
4. Test with development email backend first

**Security Note**: This 2FA implementation significantly enhances account security. Users should be educated about the importance of email security and encouraged to use strong passwords for both their accounts and email providers.
